/**
Solution summary
Sort the array in ascending order.

Loop through the entire array and set up two pointers (low and high) on every iteration.

The low pointer is set to the current loop index + 1, and high is set to the last index of the array.

Calculate the sum of array elements pointed to by the current loop index, and the low and high pointers.

If the sum is equal to the target, return TRUE.

If the sum is greater than the target, move the high pointer backward.

If the sum is less than the target, move the low pointer forward.

Repeat until the loop has processed the entire array.

If after processing the entire array, we donâ€™t find a triple that matches our requirement, we return FALSE.

Time complexity
Sorting the array: O(nlog(n))
O(nlog(n))

Nested loop to find the triplet: O(n^2)
O(n 
2
 )

The total time complexity of this solution is O(nlog(n) + n^2)
O(nlog(n)+n 
2
 )
.

Space complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1)
O(1)
 because we only use the space needed to store two index values. */
